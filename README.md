## Dataset
‚ö†Ô∏è **Some of the images may make you uncomfortable,  especially in the AIGC Human-Aware 1k** (though we have try our best to construst a comfortable while suitable dataset via very hard manually filtering.)

### COCO Human-Aware Val
COCO Human-Aware Val is an automated generation split from the COCO 2017 Val split, with XX images, each image contains an  abnormality **with** the corresponding bounding box.

### AIGC Human-Aware 1K
AIGC Human-Aware 1K is a manually annotated split with 1000 iamges. Due to the uncertainty of anomaly location, we do not annotate the bounding box in the AIGC Human-Aware 1K.


### Training Data
Download from [ü§óHugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NNaptmn/HumanCalibrator), with the ''

## Environment Preparation
Following the [LLaVa](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) , [GroundSamAnything](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything) and the [SD2](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2).


## Results
We provide all the results (with the middle results and the baselines) in XXX. In detail the results can be categoried in the following three types:

### HumanCalibrator on AIGC Human-Aware
### Other Models on AIGC Human-Aware
For the Closed-sorce VLMs (like GPT4o)


### AHD on COCO Human-aware
### Other Models on COCO Human-aware


## CKPT
The ckpt and the training log of our AHD, trained based on LLaVa1.5 7B, can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E2l9fRQq9l5YjPJnVCAnrwNQJv9uFVZ0?usp=sharing) (**llava-v1.5-7b-task-train_ver_with_neg_inpainting_1721922413_0392356_2_epoch.tar.gz**). It can be inference with the LLaVa codebase.
